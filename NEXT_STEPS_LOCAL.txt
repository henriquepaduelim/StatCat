Finalization Checklist (for local reference only)
===============================================

This document is intentionally untracked. Use it as a high-level guide for wrapping up the project from its current state.

1. Backend data migrations
   - Ensure the new Postgres database dedicated to tests (`statcat_test`) is clean.
   - Run: `source backend/.env.test && export PYTHONPATH=backend && cd backend && alembic upgrade head`.
   - For production/local data, decide whether to re-run migrations or stamp the schema, and seed using `backend/scripts/reset_db.py` if necessary.

2. Static files & media
   - Confirm that `settings.MEDIA_URL` returns absolute URLs (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/media/...`) so Team Feed images render locally and in production.
   - Sync any required media assets (logos, profile pictures) across environments.

3. Frontend finishing steps
   - Run `npm install` (if needed) and `npm run build` inside `frontend/` with `VITE_ENABLE_PWA_BUILD=true` for the final PWA bundle.
   - Verify responsive layouts (Dashboard, Team Dashboard, mobile bottom nav, logout icon).
   - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` (if available) to keep the CI green.

4. Backend quality gates
   - Execute `PYTHONPATH=backend .venv/bin/python -m pytest`.
   - Run `ruff check app` and `mypy app` prior to committing.
   - Document any remaining test data requirements or API gaps.

5. Deployment considerations
   - Update `.env` and `.env.test` with production credentials (never commit secrets).
   - If deploying to Render/Vercel, ensure `media/` storage is configured (S3 or persistent disk).
   - Double-check CORS origins and VITE env vars for production domains.

6. Product polish
   - Capture screenshots/gifs of the new Team Dashboard, Team Feed, and mobile nav for release notes.
   - Draft release notes summarizing combine metrics, community feed, and maintenance tooling.
   - Collect user/docs feedback for the next iteration (e.g. comment reactions, filters, etc.).
